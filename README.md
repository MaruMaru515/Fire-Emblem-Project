# Fire-Emblem-Project

4/11
- did not find project proposal, only found pptx with use case.  Please print to pdf and 
commit the pdf.  Your use case is too much like a flow chart.  Just show use cases, not 
the relationship between operations.  For example, you don't have to show the relationship
between signing in and creating a team.
- did not find rss/xml assignment
- did not find email assignment.
